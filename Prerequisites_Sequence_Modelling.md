# Downloadable Prerequisites for Tutorial "Sequence Modelling with Deep Learning"

The practical portion of the tutorial will take you through a Jupyter notebook on how to build your own LSTM language model for Game of Thrones using the Keras library.  

The code and files for this section are located [here](https://github.com/nslatysheva/ODSC_Sequence_Modelling).

Running the code yourself isn't necessary, but if you'd like to follow along, then you will need the following installed on your machine or in your environment:

- Python 3
- Jupyter
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Keras
- Tensorflow

The specific versions I'm using can be found in the `requirements.txt` file in the repo.

You'll also need to download the `.txt` files of all the Game of Thrones books, and the `.json` files containing all of the subtitles from the show.
